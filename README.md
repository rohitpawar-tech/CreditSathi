## Project Overview
The MSME Financial Health Scoring Platform addresses the critical need for standardized financial assessment in the SME sector. By providing a secure, scalable API, the platform allows for the ingestion of transactional data and the generation of a proprietary financial health score. This serves as a foundational tool for financial institutions, investors, and business owners to evaluate fiscal stability efficiently.

## Tech Stack
## Backend Framework: Flask
## ORM: SQLAlchemy
## Database: PostgreSQL
## Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & Bcrypt
## WSGI Server: Gunicorn
## Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

## Key Features
## 1)Secure Authentication: 
           JWT-based stateless authentication with Bcrypt password hashing.

## 2)Financial Data Tracking: 
           Comprehensive CRUD operations for Sales and Expenses.

## 3)Automated Scoring Engine:
           Real-time calculation of financial health scores based on weighted metrics.

## 4)Data Persistence: 
           Relational database integrity using PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy migrations.

## 5)Containerized Deployment: 
           Optimized Docker configuration for seamless development and production deployment.

## 6)RESTful API:
           Standardized JSON endpoints designed for high compatibility with frontend clients.


## Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and scalability:

## 1)API Layer (Routes): Handles HTTP requests, input validation, and response formatting.

## 2)Service Layer (Business Logic): Contains the core logic, including the financial scoring algorithm and transaction processing.

## 3)Data Access Layer (Models): Manages database interactions using SQLAlchemy ORM.


## 4)Authentication Layer: Middleware to verify JWT tokens and secure protected routes.

Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP server, sitting in front of the Flask application to handle concurrent requests in a production environment.
